Combine Harvest
===============
Try to discover every object you can make, using the best method.

Throwing things together until they work.

Controls
--------
Arrow keys or WASD (keycodes) to move

Esc to quit

Literally any other key to pick up / drop / swap / combine

"Install"
---------

###Windows

1. Extract CHWin.zip somewhere nice.
2. Run combineHarvest.exe

Alternatively, if you already have SDL installed on your system it may work to simply grab the executable and the assets folders `snd` and `img`. The assets folders must be in the same directory as the executable.

###Linux

1. Clone / download / whatever the whole directory (windows folder is unnecessary of course) OR extract CHLinux to your favourite new folder.
3. Ensure SDL2 is installed on your machine. Sorry folks but had some trouble removing the dependancy. 
2. Run `./combineHarvest`
